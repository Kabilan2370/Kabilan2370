*ðŸ‘‹ Hi all, fellow DevOps Engineers!

* I'm Kabilan from Tamil Nadu, India. Iâ€™m currently working at Carveniche by beGalileo as an AWS DevOps Engineer and also support the team as a Tech Support Engineer.

* Iâ€™ve been working here for the past 5 months, and Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning. Every day, I make it a point to learn something new to grow both personally and professionally.

* ðŸ‘€ My long-term goal is to become an AWS DevOps Engineer at Amazon, and Iâ€™m actively studying and preparing to achieve that dream.

* Never stop learning new things. Keep exploring something different â€” it will always give back the best to you.

* Looking forward to learning and growing with all of you!
